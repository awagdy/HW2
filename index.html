<h2> About Ahmad </h2>

<p>
My name is Ahmad Wagdy and I was born in Galveston, Texas. I moved to Cedar Rapids, Iowa when I was three years old and I have lived there since. I now live in Iowa city and I am a senor at the University of Iowa. I am majoring in Business Analytics and Information System and minoring in Coputer Science. My love for computers started when I was a kid and had a computer in my room that I tinkered with all night. The passion grew when I got my first smartphone and got pulled into the mobile world. 
</p>

<p>
I recently got married in August 2015. My wife is from Chicago and I plan to move there after I am done with college. I am interested in being a Technical Consultant in regards to security and privacy.
